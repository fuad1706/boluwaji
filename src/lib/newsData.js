Boluwaji Apanisile is a visionary creative entrepreneur passionate about storytelling through visual media.

Dedicated to elevating the creative industry, blending innovation with artistic expression to capture the essence of human experiences, he has gone ahead to push a drive for the deployment of creativity and harnessing its viable capabilities.

His work spans visual art, photography, cinematography, and motion direction, where he continuously seeks to push the boundaries of what is possible in creativity.

Apanisile believes that the Nigeria creative sector is not only an add-on to the nation’s economic structure but rather a vibrant and essential element that has a significant impact on both cultural identity and economic growth.

He also points out that Nigerian creatives are gaining international acclaim, influencing global trends in visual art, music, fashion, and film which not only enhances Nigeria’s cultural diplomacy but also promotes national pride.

Apanisile believes that the creative industry holds immense potential to impact the Nigerian economy by driving innovation, creating jobs, and promoting cultural exchange.

He adds that “Nigeria is rich in talent, and by investing in the creative sector, we can harness this talent to not only generate revenue but also to position Nigeria as a global cultural hub

. The industry can contribute to diversifying the economy, reducing dependence on traditional sectors, and fostering more inclusive economic growth.”

One of the major challenges for creatives in Nigeria is the lack of infrastructure and support systems, the creative entrepreneur further emphasised.

He pointed out that, many creatives struggle with access to funding, mentorship, and professional development opportunities. There is also the challenge of intellectual property protection, which hinders creatives from fully benefiting from their work. To tackle these issues, there needs to be a concerted effort from both the public and private sectors to build a supportive ecosystem—this includes better access to financial resources, legal protections, and platforms that enable creatives to showcase and monetise their work.”

As Apanisile continues his mission of bolstering the creative industry in Nigeria, his company, NAKESTUDiOS held its first iCre8 conference last month.

The conference was an immersive and engaging event that brought together creatives from diverse industries for a powerful and inspirational session. For the convener, the next steps for the icre8 conference involve building on the success of the first edition by expanding its reach and impact.

He adds that, “We plan to introduce more interactive sessions, workshops, and collaboration opportunities that allow participants to not only learn but also apply what they’ve learned in real time.

“Subsequent editions will focus on deepening the conversations around creativity and its role in economic development, with an emphasis on actionable insights and solutions. We aim to make icre8 a must-attend event for anyone in the creative industry, both locally and internationally.”

Looking ahead, Boluwaji intends to explore new ways to blend creativity with impact. This could mean venturing into new forms of media, exploring tech-driven creative solutions, or even getting involved in initiatives that drive social change through art he explains.

For Nakestudios, the focus remains on pushing the boundaries of visual storytelling while also expanding into new markets and mediums, saying “We are looking at collaborations that can bring fresh perspectives to our work and exploring opportunities in content creation, immersive experiences, and perhaps even education helping to nurture the next generation of creatives.”
